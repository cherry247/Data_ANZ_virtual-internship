# Data_ANZ_virtual-internship

I have completed this internship using python. check out my other data science projects [here](https://github.com/cherry247/Data-Science).
Its open-access virtual internships.  Which allows students to build career skills, gain experience and increase their understanding of different careers. The project that I chose was DATA@ANZ. There were two tasks to be performed. First one was exploratory data analysis in which I had to Segment the dataset and draw unique insights, including visualisation of the transaction volume and assessing the effect of any outliers. The skills that I gained from this project were data segmentation, data visualization & analytics.
The second task was predictive analysis.Explore correlations between customer attributes, build a regression and a decision-tree prediction model based on your findings.
